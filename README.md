# Predicting Production and Delivery Timelines 🚚⏱️

## Overview 🌟
This project focuses on predicting the time required for a product to move through different stages of production and delivery. By leveraging historical data, the goal is to enable better planning, improve efficiency, and meet customer expectations more effectively.

## Features 🚀
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Utilizes historical production and delivery data.
  - Estimates time required for various stages of the process.

- **Optimized Planning**:
  - Helps businesses optimize operations and streamline processes.
  - Improves decision-making and ensures timely deliveries.

- **Business Application**:
  - Designed specifically for industries like steel manufacturing, but adaptable to other domains.

## Key Contributions 🧑‍💻
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and prepared raw data for analysis.
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and normalized data for better model performance.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Identified critical variables impacting production and delivery timelines.
   - Reduced noise in data to enhance prediction accuracy.

3. **Machine Learning Implementation**:
   - Developed a predictive model using algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Linear Regression.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
